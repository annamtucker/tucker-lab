abstract: Wildlife populations are experiencing shifting dynamics due to climate
  and landscape change. Management policies that fail to account for
  non-stationary dynamics may fail to achieve management objectives. We
  establish a framework for understanding optimal strategies for managing a
  theoretical harvested population under non-stationarity. Building from harvest
  theory, we develop scenarios representing changes in population growth rate
  (r) or carrying capacity (K) and derive time-dependent optimal harvest
  policies using stochastic dynamic programming. We then evaluate the cost of
  falsely assuming stationarity by comparing the outcomes of forward projections
  in which either the optimal policy or a stationary policy is applied. When K
  declines over time, the stationary policy leads to an underharvest of the
  population, resulting in less harvest over the short term, but leaving the
  population in a higher-value state. When r declines over time, the stationary
  policy leads to overharvest, resulting in greater harvest returns in the short
  term but leaving the population in a lower and potentially more vulnerable
  state. This work demonstrates the basic properties of time-dependent harvest
  management and provides a framework for evaluating the many outstanding
  questions about optimal management strategies under climate change.
